This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of classifying images of cats, dogs, and wild animals. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled animal images and uses deep learning techniques to accurately predict the category of each image. The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate classification system that can distinguish between domestic pets and wild animals, with potential applications in image recognition-based games or wildlife monitoring systems.
